# 🏠 California Housing Price Analysis

This project explores housing prices in California using data from the 1990 Census. The goal was to identify which factors influence the **mean house value** in different neighborhoods.

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build a linear regression model
- Identify the most important predictors of housing price
- Interpret model results and coefficients

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Median income** is the strongest positive predictor of housing value.
- Homes located **farther inland** tend to be significantly cheaper.
- Surprisingly, more **total rooms** or **population** didn’t always mean higher value — suggesting deeper multicollinearity.
- The regression model explained a meaningful portion of the variance in housing prices.
